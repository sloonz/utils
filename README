This is a set of useful (at least for me) scripts:

 * php/cgi-bin.php: a PHP script which can execute any CGI script for
   hosts allowing PHP but not CGI
 * him: a set of scripts for image hashing. Documentation is the code.
 * aencode: frontend to mkvtools and aacplusenc
 * bank-mailer: a simple interface to weboob to send by mails all
   operations on bank account
 * bf: a script which reads all STDIN and writes it to its argument. Can
   be used to safely read and write in the same file (for example,
   cat myfile | grep ... | other filters | bf myfile)
 * editor: runs scite when X is running, vim if X isn't running
 * encode: a frontend to mencoder to encode x264 files
 * mkv-list and mkv-extract: frontends to mkvtoolnix
 * mnt: command-line interface to udisks (aka devicekit-disks, the
   successor of hal)
 * pdf2djvu: a pdf to djvu converter which can manage the text layer of
   the file
 * pren: batch renaming with perl regular expresions
 * qiv-command: an implementation of qiv-command wich simply evaluate
   QIV_ACTIONn when n is pressed
 * random: print one of its argument
 * runvb: simple script to manage multiple VirtualBox disk images
 * scan: a simple interface to sane to create DjVu files
 * sci: a frontend to scite remote interface. sci foo.c:42 will open 
   foo.c and go to line 42
 * scimake is a simple makefile generator intended for really small 
   projects (in facts, more for small tests). It works by adding a 
   comment in the head of the file to compile, e.g.
    // ~ cflags: -O0
    // ~ depends: bar.c
   and then running scimake foo.c build
   The documentation is the code ;)
 * tcproxy: a generic SOCKS (v4) proxy to dump data exchanged between a client
   and a server. To use it : run the server on port X (./tcproxy X) and then
   socksify the application to use the proxy (tsocks wget http://google.fr)
 * wmii_systemload.c: a system load (CPU/mem/swap) for wmii2

There is also a set of userchrome.js scripts to put in your chrome/ folder
for firefox (various helpers, keyboard navigation)
Edit userChrome.js to load the scripts you need.
